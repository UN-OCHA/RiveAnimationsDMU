# Rive animations tests

This repository is used by BDU to test animations created with Rive.  
Rive is a design and animation tool that allows you to create lightweight, interactive vector animations that can run on the web, in apps, and in UI systems. Animations are exported as small runtime files and can react to user input, state changes, or triggers.

## Purpose of this repo  
- Experiment with Rive features and workflows  
- Test how Rive animations behave in the browser  
- Explore possible uses for interactive humanitarian content  
- Store draft animation files and code examples for internal reference

## Contents  
- `.riv` source files created in the Rive editor  
- Test HTML files to preview animations  
- Any support assets or scripts needed for experimentation
